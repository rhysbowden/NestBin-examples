# NestBin-examples
Examples of usage for the NestBin R package, and scripts used to generate the plots in the accompanying paper Bowden et al., "Simulating binary random variables with two levels of clustering".

Files:
rNestBin_example.R 
Example usage of rNestBin(), included in the paper.

LCRT_NestExch.R
Function to generate data from a Longitudinal Cluster Randomized Trial using rNestBin() from the NestBin package.

LCRT_NestExch_example.R
Example usage of LCRT_NestExch().

be_test_search.R
Script to find and compare the limits of simulatable correlations for different methods for generating correlated binary data with nested exchangeable correlation structure. Also plots these limits.

be_test_timing.R
Script to compare the running times of different methods for generating correlated binary data.
